Secure Documents module

This module is based on the Documents module shipped with Appleseed 2005, 
see the readme.Documents.txt for information about the original

SecureDocuments adds 2 features:

1)Document based security.  Each document has checkboxes which
determine which roles can see the document.
2)Each document can have multiple files associated with it.

Multiple files are controlled by addding column names in the module settings.
This is a ; delimited list which will be used as headings for each file
that is associated with the Document. This is the limiting factor, you 
can associate more files with a document, but they will not be displayed
unless they have a corresponding column header.
