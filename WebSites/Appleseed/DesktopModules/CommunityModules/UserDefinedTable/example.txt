A quick introduction to User Defined Table Module
-------------------------------------------------

Step 0: Login to your Portal as Administrator
Step 1: Copy the files "example1.xslt" and "example2.xslt" and "example3.xslt" and "example4.xslt" 
        to your Portal Root directory (for example  \Portals\Appleseed\ )

Step 2: Add a User Defined Table Module (UDT) to a page of your Portal.
Step 3: Click the 'Manage Table' button and add 2 fields:
        field 1:  Name='title'     Type='Text'
        field 2:  Name='artist'    Type='Text'
Step 4: Click the ADD icon to add at least one record. Fill in the data of your favorite CD. Save the data.

RESULT: Now you see the data in it's traditional layout.

Step 5: Change the properties of this UDT like this:
        XSL source: example1.xls       (note: don't provide the path \Portals\Appleseed\)
        XSL data = 0
        Display XML = False

RESULT: Now you see the data in a table that is defined in the .xslt file
        This .xslt file transforms the underlying XML data file using XSL
        For introduction to XSL see http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xsl_intro.asp
        The design a good XSL file you need to know the underlying XML structure (see step 6)

Step 6: Change the properties of this UDT like this:
        Display XML = True
        !! NOTE: While being on the Edit Module Properties page 
        !!       make a note of the mID parameter in the URL of the current page.
        !!       This is the ID of this module. We will need it in a while.

RESULT: Now you see the data in XML format. 
        Notice that each record has an additional field holding the URL to edit the data.
        This URL is used to provide an Edit button.
        You can only use one XSL file per UDT

Step 7: Add a SECOND UDT to the same page
Step 8: Change the properties of this UDT like this:
        XSL source: example2.xls       (note: don't provide the path \Portals\Appleseed\)
        XSL data = <mID that you noted in Step 6>
        Display XML = False
        
RESULT: Now you see the data of the First UDT in a table as is defined in the Second .xslt file
        Using the strong select features of XSL this gives you a very flexible tool to display data
        of one table in different ways thoughout the whole Portal.

Step 9: Add a THIRTH UDT to the same page
Step 8: Change the properties of this UDT like this:
        XSL source: example3.xls       (note: don't provide the path \Portals\Appleseed\)
        XSL data = <mID that you noted in Step 6>
        Display XML = False
        
RESULT: Now you see the data of the First UDT in a table as is defined in the thirth .xslt file
        But this time you can click on the fields in the Table header to change the sort direction.
        When you look inside example3.xslt you will see that a special link is used to get this result.
        Namely link to  href="@@sort.xxxxxxx@@" replacing xxxxxxx with the name op field. 
        Note that this is case sensitive !!

Step 9: Add a FOURTH UDT to the same page
Step 8: Change the properties of this UDT like this:
        XSL source: example4.xls       (note: don't provide the path \Portals\Appleseed\)
        XSL data = <mID that you noted in Step 6>
        Display XML = False

RESULT: Now you see the data of the First UDT in a table as is defined in the fourth .xslt file
        But this time you also have a link "Show detail" which show that perticular record in the way as defined in the XLST file.
        When you look inside example4.xslt you will see that is much more complicated that the previous files.
        But don't be dassled by this, because you don't have to change much.
        You only have to change two parts, namely after  <!-- START - LIST VIEW TEMPATE -->  and   <!-- START - DETAIL VIEW TEMPATE -->
        
        Note that this XSL uses special command @@imgsortorder.xxxxx@@ where xxxxx is fieldname.  
        This string if found in XSL will be replaced by an IMG specifying the order in which this field is ordered. 
        If this field isn't ordered, that it will be replace by a empty string.
        Note that this is case sensitive !!
        
        Note that this XSL uses css classes Grid_Header and Grid_Item
	
	Note that this XSL supports multilingual text using method nr 4 explained on this site:
	http://www.topxml.com/xsltStylesheets/xslt_multilingual.asp
	
	Note: Esperantus support !!
	Whenever you use the string @@localize.ESPERANTUSKEY@@ where 'ESPERANTUSKEY' is replaced by a valid key (case sensitive !) 
	then this string is replaced by the appropriate value of the key in the current language
        Note that this is case sensitive !!
