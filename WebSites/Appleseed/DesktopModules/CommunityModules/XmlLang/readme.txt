HISTORY
Ver. 1.0 - created by Jes
Ver. 1.1 - 4th October 2003 - John Mandia (www.whitelightsolutions.com) - Moved all files to folder \XmlLang and fixed the 
           XSL document in _Appleseed and added the sample files to module directory


Issues and Known problems:
- 

Module settings
---------------
There are no settings for this module just point to the xml and xsl file.
Included are two demo files one xml and one xsl which can be dropped into the xml folder of your portal e.g. _Appleseed
Have a look at the xsl document to see how to take advantage of this module.

In a default Appleseed installation...drop the XmlLang module onto a tab and then add xml/sales2.xml and xml/sales2.xsl as the settings.
